## Decision Tree Implementation [6 marks]

1. Complete the decision tree implementation in tree/base.py. The code should be written in Python and not use existing libraries other than the ones shared in class or already imported in the code. Your decision tree should work for four cases: i) discrete features, discrete output; ii) discrete features, real output; iii) real features, discrete output; real features, real output. <u>Your model should accept real inputs only (for discrete inputs, you may convert the attributes into one-hot encoded vectors)</u>. Your decision tree should be able to use InformationGain using Entropy or GiniIndex as the criteria for splitting for discrete output. Your decision tree should be able to use InformationGain using MSE as the criteria for splitting for real output. Your code should also be able to plot/display the decision tree.  **[2.5 marks]**

# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) refers to the capability of machines to identify various activities performed by the users. The knowledge acquired from these systems/algorithms is integrated into many applications where the associated device uses it to identify actions or gestures and performs predefined tasks in response.

## Dataset
We are interested in classifying human activities based on accelerometer data. we will be using a publically available dataset called [UCI-HAR](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8567275). The dataset is available to download [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones). Just for your reference a youtube video of the authors collecting participant's accelerometer data is also available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEN9W05_4A). 

## Task 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) [3 marks]

### Preprocessing
We will use the raw accelerometer data within the inertial_signals folder. The provided script, `CombineScript.py`, organizes and sorts accelerometer data, establishing separate classes for each category and compiling participant data into these classes. `MakeDataset.py` script is used to read through all the participant data and create a single dataset. The dataset is then split into train,test and validation set. We focus on the first 10 seconds of activity, translating to the initial 500 data samples due to a sampling rate of 50Hz.

* **Step-1>** Place the `CombineScript.py` and `MakeDataset.py` in the same folder that contains the UCI dataset. Ensure you have moved into the folder before running the scripts. If you are runing the scripts from a different folder, you will have to play around with the paths in the scripts to make it work.
* **Step-2>** Run `CombineScript.py` and provide the paths to test and train folders in UCI dataset. This will create a folder called `Combined` which will contain all the data from all the participants. This is how most of the datasets are organized. You may encounter similar dataset structures in the future.
* **Step-3>** Run `MakeDataset.py` and provide the path to `Combined` folder. This will create a Dataset which will contain the train, test and validation set. You can use this dataset to train your models.


### Questions

1. Plot the waveform for one sample data from each activity class. Are you able to see any difference/similarities between the activities? You can plot a subplot having 6 columns to show differences/similarities between the activities. Do you think the model will be able to classify the activities based on the data? **[0.5 marks]**
2. Do you think we need a machine learning model to differentiate between static activities (laying, sitting, standing) and dynamic activities(walking, walking_downstairs, walking_upstairs)? Look at the linear acceleration $(acc_x^2+acc_y^2+acc_z^2)$ for each activity and justify your answer. **[0.5 marks]**
3. Visualize the data using PCA. **[1 marks]**
    * Use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on Total Acceleration $(acc_x^2+acc_y^2+acc_z^2)$ to compress the acceleration timeseries into two features and plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities. 
    *  Next, use [TSFEL](https://tsfel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ([a featurizer library](https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel)) to create features (your choice which ones you feel are useful) and then perform PCA to obtain two features. Plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities. 
    *  Now use the features provided by the dataset and perform PCA to obtain two features. Plot a scatter plot to visualize different class of activities.
    *  Compare the results of PCA on Total Acceleration, TSFEL and the dataset features. Which method do you think is better for visualizing the data? 
4. Calculate the correlation matrix of the features obtained by TSFEL and provided in the dataset. Identify the features that are highly correlated with each other. Are there any redundant features? **[1 marks]**


## Task 2 : Decision Trees for Human Activity Recognition [3 marks]

### Questions

1. Use Sklearn Library to train Decision Tress. **[1.5 marks]**
    * Train a decision tree model using the raw accelerometer data. Report the accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix of the model. 
    * Train a decision tree model using the features obtained by TSFEL. Report the accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix of the model. 
    * Train a decision tree model using the features provided in the dataset. Report the accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix of the model. 
    * Compare the results of the three models. Which model do you think is better? 
2. Train Decision Tree with varying depths (2-8) using all above 3 methods. Plot the accuracy of the model on test data vs the depth of the tree. **[1 marks]**
3. Are there any participants/ activitivies where the Model performace is bad? If Yes, Why? **[0.5 mark]**

## Task 3 : Data Collection in the Wild [2 marks]

## Task Description
For this exercise marks will not depend on what numbers you get but on the process you followed Utilize apps like `Physics Toolbox Suite` from your smartphone to collect your data in .csv/.txt format. Ensure at least 15 seconds of data is collected, trimming edges to obtain 10 seconds of relevant data. Also record a video of yourself while recording data. This video will be required in some future assignments. Collect 3-5 samples per activity class.

### Things to take care of:
* Ensure the phone is placed in the same position for all the activities.
* Ensure the phone is in the same alignment during the activity as changing the alignment will change the data collected and will affect the model's performance.
* Ensure to have atleast 10s of data per file for training. As the data is collected at 50Hz, you will have 500 data samples.

### Questions
1. Use the Decision Tree model trained on the UCI-HAR dataset to predict the activities that you performed. Report the accuracy, precision, recall and confusion matrix of the model. You have three version of UCI dataset you can use a)Raw data from accelerometer, b)TSFEL featurised data, c)Features provided by author. Choose which version to use, ensuring that your test data is similar to your training data. How did the model perform? **[1 marks]**
2. Use the data you collected to predict the activities that you performed. Decide whether to apply preprocessing and featurization, and if so, choose the appropriate methods. How did the model perform? **[1 marks]**



# **Genral Instructions :**
1. Show your results in a Jupyter Notebook or an MD file. If you opt for using an MD file, you should also include the code.
